            <strong>What is the definition of Authentication and web security?</strong> Authentication is used by a server when the server needs to know exactly who is accessing their information or site. Authentication is used by a client when the client needs to know that the server is system it claims to be. In authentication, the user or computer must prove its identity to the server or client.

            <strong>What is the definition of Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)?</strong> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.

            <strong>What is the definition of Session management?</strong> Session management refers to the process of securely handling multiple requests to a web-based application or service from a single user or entity. Websites and browsers use HTTP to communicate, and a session is a series of HTTP requests and transactions initiated by the same user.

        <strong>What is the definition of Stateless programming?</strong> Stateless programming refers to a design approach where a program does not maintain any internal state between different executions or interactions. This means that each request or function call is independent and does not rely on any previous interactions.

            <strong>What are the three major programming control structures?</strong><br> 1. Sequential Logic (Sequential Flow) 
    
            Sequential logic as the name suggests follows a serial or sequential flow in which the flow depends on the series of instructions given to the computer. Unless new instructions are given, the modules are executed in the obvious sequence. The sequences may be given, by means of numbered steps explicitly. Also, implicitly follows the order in which modules are written. Most of the processing, even some complex problems, will generally follow this elementary flow pattern. 
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Selection Logic (Conditional Flow) 
            
            Selection logic or Conditional statements are tests to return whether a given comparison between two variables is True or False. They are used in combination with if-statements to control the flow of a program. 
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Iteration Logic (Repetitive Flow) 
            
            The Iteration logic employs a loop which involves a repeat statement followed by a module known as the body of a loop.

            <strong>What is HTML (Hypertext markup language) and markup languages in general?</strong> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationship between its parts.

            <br>
            <strong>What is CSS (Casading style sheets)?</strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colours, and fonts.

            <br>
            <strong>What is syntax and its use in programming languages?</strong> Syntax refers to the rules that define the structure of a language. Syntax in computer programming means the rules that control the structure of the symbols, punctuation, and words of a programming language.
