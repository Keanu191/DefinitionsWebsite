            <strong>What are the principles of analysis and design?</strong>
            There are twelve basic principles of design: contrast, balance, emphasis, proportion, hierarchy, repetition,
            rhythm, pattern, white space, movement, variety, and unity. These visual and graphic design principles work
            together to create appealing and functional designs that make sense to users.

            <strong>What are website architectural requirements?</strong> Website architecture is the hierarchical
            structure of your website pages. This structure is reflected through internal linking. Your website's
            structure should help users easily find information and help search engine crawlers understand the
            relationship between different pages.

          <strong>What are website design structures, including hierarchy and navigation design?</strong> It involves
          the hierarchical arrangement of web pages and their relationships to one another. Website structure helps
          visitors and search engines navigate and understand the website's content. There are four types of website
          architectures: hierarchical, sequential, matrix, database.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>What are user-interface design requirements and production processes?</strong> The interface design
          process involves creating wireframes, mock-ups, and prototypes of the visual elements and interactions. The
          user experience design process includes research, user personas, user flows, and usability testing to improve
          the overall experience.

            <strong>What are programming controls and design structures?</strong> In the world of Computer Science,
            programming control structures are essential components that dictate the flow of execution within a program.
            These structures help you organise your code effectively and optimise its performance.

            <strong>What are website testing procedures?</strong> <br> Step 1: Functionality testing.
            <br>
            Step 2: Usability testing – not only for user experience.
            <br>
            Step 3: Interface testing.
            <br>
            Step 4: Compatibility testing.
            <br>
            Step 5: Performance testing.

            <strong>What are website debugging methods?</strong><br> In the context of software engineering, debugging
            is the process of fixing a bug in the software. When there’s a problem with software, programmers analyse
            the code to figure out why things aren’t working correctly. They use different debugging tools to carefully
            go through the code, step by step, find the issue, and make the necessary corrections.
            <br>
            Step 1: Reproduce the Bug
            <br>
            Step 2: Locate the Bug
            <br>
            Step 3: Identify the Root Cause
            <br>
            Step 4: Fix the Bug
            <br>
            Step 5: Test the Fix
            <br>
            Step 6: Document the Process

            <strong>What are some website coding techniques?</strong> <br> 1. Always consider accessibility when coding
            a website.
            <br>
            2. Coding building blocks are the best way to get started.
            <br>
            3. When coding a website, keep track of your changes.
            <br>
            4. Coding a website and debugging go together.
            <br>
            5. Coding needs to consider all users, in multiple versions.
            <br>
            6. Keep an eye on the latest industry and coding trends.
